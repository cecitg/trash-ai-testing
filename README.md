Training Data Storage:

We create a Training Data storage to contain all the data we will use to build our IA, working with a Machine Learning algorithm. With the datasets in our machine learning, we can train the ML model.
The Platform Training reads data from the Data Storage located where we have granted access to our AI platform training (in this case is on google colab).

The team is searching for a model that has been trained as a proof of concept (POC). POCs has the intention to prove that new technology/service/idea is viable for the market.
The POCs involves a developers examining the clientâ€™s requirements, selecting a few to focus on, and creating a proof of concept to meet those requirements.
Trained model is available for view:

We try to send Travis CI but it did not recive and updated version, we couldn't triger the travis again.

This fork code does not have the same code from the main repo.
This code is for our task 2 of our group and it used to show Training Data Storage on colab.
